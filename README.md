# NLP Cyberbullying Detection

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting cyberbullying using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Cyberbullying is a significant issue in the digital age, affecting individuals' mental health and well-being. The aim of this project is to develop a robust model that can identify and flag instances of cyberbullying from textual data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Cyberbullying Tweets dataset available on Kaggle. It contains comments labeled as cyberbullying or not, providing a valuable resource for training and testing the detection model.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collecting and preprocessing data to build a comprehensive dataset for training and testing.
- **Textual Analysis**: Utilizing NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to analyze the textual data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implementing feature extraction methods including TF-IDF, word embeddings, and sentiment analysis to capture the nuances of the text.
- **Model Development**: Developing and training machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes to detect cyberbullying.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-Learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
